# MOM6 Pan-Antarctic Model

1/40° regional model south of 37°S. MOM6-SIS2 coupled configuration,
forced at the open boundary by one year of daily output from
ACCESS-OM2-01 RYF, and at the surface by JRA55v13 RYF. This repository
contains the model configurations, and the scripts required to
generate the input forcing.

For up to date diagnostics on the model output see the [mom6-panan-diagnostics](https://github.com/COSIMA/mom6-panan-diagnostics) repository.
